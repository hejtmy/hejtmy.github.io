    <p>I am full time neurosciences PhD student at the 3rd Medical Faculty, Charles University in Prague. I do most of my work at the Institutes ogf Physiology, ASCR and the National Institute of Mental Health, Czech Republic. My focus is on spatial representations, navigation and memory and its neural correlates. We work with scalp and intracranial EEG, fMRI, eyetracking and virtual reality.</p>
<p>Most of my work is spent in front of PC screens, writing thousands of lines of code in R, Python C#, Matlab, Latex, and Javascript, but I have done projects of varying size in Ruby, Lua BASIC and others. Modern neuroscience is just programming.</p>
<p>When I am not programming for money, I am programming for fun. I like working of as many projects as humanly possible and failing to finish any of them. I think the last thing that defines my is my obscene collection of boardgames. I have so many that I actually can&rsquo;t play them all and some of them are sitting silently on the shelves for years. All the money I make is drown in the immense amount of cardboard, wood and plastic I store in our home.</p>
<p>The only thing I regret is not investing in something that doesnt burn.</p>
