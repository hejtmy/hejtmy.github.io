I am a researcher by profession, programmer by necessity and a teacher and a gamer by heart. My focus is on spatial representations, navigation, memory and their behavioral and occasionaly neural correlates. I predominantly use virtual reality as a means of exploring these topics by preparing exciting experiments in Unity3D and Unreal Engine. I am also interested in the general use of virtual reality as a investigative tool in psychology and neuroscience.

Most of my work is spent in front of PC screens, writing thousands of lines of code in R, Python C#, Matlab, Latex, and Javascript, but I have done projects of varying size in Ruby, Lua, BASIC and others.

I am currently holding the position of an assistant professor or psychology at Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague. I also do research at the Institutes of Psychology, ASCR, National Institute of Mental Health, Czech Republic and the University of Life Sciences, Prague.

Under the patronage of my employers, I lead a group of young undergraduate and graduate students called [CyberSpaceLab](https://cyberspacelab.cz/), where we explore the use of virtual reality in psychology and neuroscience.

I think the last thing that defines me is my obscene collection of boardgames. I have so many that I actually can't play them all and some of them are sitting silently on the shelves for years. All the money I make is drown in the immense amount of cardboard, wood and plastic I store in our home. 

The only thing I regret is not investing in something that doesnt burn.
